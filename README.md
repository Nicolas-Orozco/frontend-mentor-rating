## My process

This repo :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- How to use, hide and style radio inputs
- Tailwind Breakpoints
- Peer, after and other pseudo elements, classes
- Pass, receive and query data from url

### Continued development

Use darkened versions of theme colors without explictly declaring them.
Improve and make responsive sizes for images.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - I think this is obvious.
- [Write text inside Radio Buttons](https://codepen.io/w3programmings/pen/zzRKpy) - This example helped me a lot when heavy styling radio inputs.
